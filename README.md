# Map Reduce

The following files do the following:

1. Select pages from a PDF file and create a separate PDF file from it
2. Select pages within that new PDF file and create txt files
3. Apply MapReduce functions
4. Save new data in a new PDF

There is a Jupyter Notebook with a step-by-step and a connection to Google Drive to download the PDF file in the Kernel, and a Python file that runs everything.
